These are handmade, deterministic scenes captured with the current game renderer—not concept art. The
[88-frame showcase archive](public/media/showcase-r1/manifest.json) contains 13 owner-selected scenes, 30 action frames,
30 close foreground compositions, five directed Studio frames, and ten interface states. The
[landing selection](public/media/landing-r1/manifest.json) records the six hero frames, feature reel, five camera-rail
films, 24-shot mosaic, and directed Strv 122 versus Leclerc sequence now published on the site.

## Fight, inspect, and direct

  <img src="public/brand/nav/studio.svg" width="72" alt="Scene Studio icon" title="Direct">
</p>

- **Fight:** enter Standard Battle, Capture the Flag, Zone Control, armed super-speed Turbo Ball, or cooperative
  Endless Horde in solo or multiplayer, with physical shell travel, armor geometry, component damage, spotting,
  terrain, collision, destructible structures, persistent wrecks, mode-specific respawns, and authority-owned results.
- **Inspect:** open any vehicle in Tank Gallery, articulate the live rig, isolate armor or internal anatomy, and export an
  exact-surface review packet from the same specification used in combat.
- **Direct:** stage any roster vehicle on any battlefield in Scene Studio, animate actors and cameras, schedule game FX,
  and capture stills or video from reproducible scene data.

## Current release

The fleet does not reduce every vehicle to the same gun and movement model. Specifications can add their own loading,
guidance, suspension, ammunition, anatomy, and control behavior while remaining inside the fixed-step authority.

- **Magazine autoloaders** track ready rounds, intra-magazine cycle time, full replenishment, manual magazine reloads,
  shell changes, and damage to the loading mechanism. The Leclerc, Type 90, PL-01, and four-round PL-01 105 each carry
  their own magazine timings.
- **Guided missiles** travel at visible weapon-specific speeds and steer toward the authority-owned aim point. Launcher
  damage, rack damage, ammunition count, reload state, guidance, impact, and presentation all remain synchronized.
- **Hydropneumatic aim** uses the same canonical pose for armor, muzzle, collision, wheels, tracks, remote snapshots, and
  the camera; there is no separate visual-only tank tilt.
- **Free look** keeps the sight and turret on target while the camera moves. Hold `Shift` on keyboard, `RB` on a standard
  controller, or assign another binding in settings.

- **Plate-level armor** resolves the actual plate, slope, impact angle, normalization, ricochet, overmatch, spaced armor,
  composites, ERA, and separate kinetic/chemical protection.
- **Five ammunition families** model muzzle velocity, gravity, penetration loss, ricochet, and damage differently.
- **Internal anatomy** tracks crew, ammunition racks, engine, fuel, gun, turret ring, optics, radio, and tracks.
- **Tank-specific mobility** combines drivetrain, terrain resistance, per-wheel support, suspension-damped hull attitude,
  flexible terrain-following tracks, collision, ramming, and crushable cover.
- **Real battlefield knowledge** combines view range, concealment, movement/firing bloom, foliage, radio sharing, and the
  15 m bush rule. Multiplayer authority filters hidden enemies before serializing a snapshot.

Every playable hull, turret, gun, fitting, suspension, road wheel, and track run is assembled by the repository's
first-party vehicle pipeline. Vehicle changes pass combat-anatomy receipts, generated technical diagrams, geometry
checks, visual fingerprints, and a targeted release gate.

## Renderer, drivers, and performance

<p>
  <img src="public/brand/features/gpu.svg" width="52" alt="GPU renderer icon" title="GPU-aware renderer">
</p>

The renderer treats quality as a device contract instead of a single desktop preset. It selects a GPU/driver-aware
profile, caps pixel density, prewarms shader paths, adapts costly effects, and can recover from a black frame or WebGL
context loss. The current presentation path combines:

- four quality-scaled, stable texel-anchored shadow cascades with articulation-aware tank shadow hulls;
- fused output grading, anti-aliasing, adaptive render scale, fog/atmosphere, and bounded transparent depth work;
- instance/batch paths for repeated world objects, pooled particles, and explicit GPU resource disposal;
- reusable hot-loop scratch state, fixed-step simulation, render interpolation, and high-refresh presentation;
- an in-game diagnostics surface for FPS, ping, frame timing, draw calls, triangles, memory, network telemetry, quality,
  and renderer/driver identity.

The renderer reached **120 FPS on the certified test hardware**. Actual performance depends on refresh rate, browser,
thermal limits, GPU and driver, resolution, and quality level. Combat rules remain fixed at 60 Hz at every render rate.

## Multiplayer

<p>
  <img src="public/brand/features/multiplayer.svg" width="52" alt="Multiplayer tanks icon" title="Authoritative multiplayer">
</p>

Local, LAN, browser-hosted private, and dedicated ranked modes share the same renderer-free movement and combat rules.
Clients send intent, never trusted hits or damage. Snapshot filtering, local prediction/reconciliation, bounded remote
interpolation, reliable fire edges, reconnectable room state, and separate control/chat delivery keep a moving and firing
7v7 battle responsive without giving the client authority.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/media/multiplayer-r1/dual-perspective.webp" alt="Side-by-side live browser multiplayer screens showing an M1A2 Abrams and T-90M Proryv facing each other from opposing player perspectives">
</p>
<p align="center"><sub><b>Two screens, opposing sights:</b> paired live 1v1 captures preserve the real battle HUD, authoritative simulation, filtered snapshots, and each commander's view.</sub></p>

### Controls at a glance

| Action | Keyboard and mouse | Standard controller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drive and steer | `WASD` or arrow keys | Left stick |
| Aim and fire | Mouse + `LMB` | Right stick + `RT` |
| Precision sight | Hold `RMB` by default; wheel in also enters | `LT` |
| Free look without moving the turret | Hold `Shift` or `Left Alt` | `RB` |
| Select ammunition | `1` / `2` / `3` | D-pad |
| Vehicle-specific action | `E` | `LB` |
| Reload a partial magazine | `C` | Remappable |
| Consumables | `4` / `5` / `6` | Remappable |
| Handbrake | `Space` | `A` |
| Shot log / performance / menu | `L` / `F8` / `Esc` | Interface controls |

Every desktop action is remappable. `RMB` can use hold-to-aim, toggle-aim, or classic free-look behavior. Touch devices
receive dedicated movement, aim, scope, fire, ammunition, equipment, and special-action controls rather than a scaled
desktop HUD.

Scene Studio works with the runtime rather than a separate cinematic renderer. Vehicles, camouflage, camera, lighting,
recoil, tracers, explosions, sparks, smoke, debris, wreck state, and timeline events remain scene data. A saved scene can
be replayed, scrubbed, edited, exported as JSON, captured as a high-resolution still, or recorded as a video.

Regenerate the current public archive:

```bash
npm run shots:battle:generate
npm run shots:battle:grade -- --root shots/marketing-battles-r3
node tools/marketing-shots/capture-multiplayer-dual-screen.mjs
npm run studio:action:render
npm run showcase:publish
npm run showcase:check
npm run landing:media:publish
```

The capture harness serializes concurrent jobs, starts a clean local game, verifies the requested state, and records
current rendering diagnostics. `public/media/showcase-r1/manifest.json` defines the source archive;
`public/media/landing-r1/manifest.json` records the public hero, rail, mosaic, and Studio selections with their actor,
effect, duration, dimensions, and byte receipts.

The same run is reviewed in contact sheets before any frame becomes a 4K master. These collection views make weak
silhouettes, obstructed cameras, repeated compositions, and overpowered effects obvious before automated grading.
